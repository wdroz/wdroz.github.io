## Hello from Switzerland 😁

### About me 🧔🏼

I’ve been programming since 2004 and I got my master degree in software engineering in 2015. I worked as a research assistant at “He-arc Ingénierie” until 2018. I'm now working as a Research and Development Engineer at Idiap. With my work, I have the opportunity to play with some cutting edge technologies, like Pytorch, Tensorflow and Spark.

My skills

*  ✔️ Machine learning
*  ✔️ Python
*  ✔️ Databases (both SQL and noSQL)
*  ✔️ Tools (git, bash, Gnu/Linux, Docker, Docker-compose, ssh, gRPC)
*  ✔️ Others (Distributed computing, Optimization, Back-end)
*  ❌ Apple things (No, I will not make an iOS app)
*  ❌ Javascript (I rather use WASM than touching JS code)

I'm currently toying with Rust for my new projects, and I really like this language.

### 🔧 Ongoing projects:

[noabspath](https://github.com/wdroz/noabspath) *Detect hard-coded absolute paths in your codebases*. I created this project because I work with people who like to write absolute paths everywhere and unfortunately they rarely ship their computer with their code. This project is written in Rust.

### ⛔️ Old projects and/or student projects

All my other projects not mentionned before are trash, but I don't want to delete them. *please don't explore my garbage.*
